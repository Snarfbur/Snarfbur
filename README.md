# Introduction

### Why I'm Here
I love fantasy role playing since the eigthies and developing software even earlier. I have seen a lot of things coming and going, specialy around addons for pen & paper role playing. You can still find a lot of good solutions on the internet, but they are hard to find between all this dead projects. One of the exceptions is [MapTool](https://www.rptools.net/toolbox/maptool/) from [RpTools](https://www.rptools.net/}.
Second I'm intrested in AI and would like to extend [Rails-18xx]{https://sourceforge.net/projects/rails/} ([Rails on GitHup]{https://github.com/Rails-18xx}) with a computer gamer.

Both could be done just inside this projects, but I prefer to start alone until I have something to show. Then thye can disede to integrate it or I will try to hold it uptodate by myself.


### Why Now
I just retired and beside travelling around and playing my compaign with my group, this is the first time after 30 years, that I feal that I have enough time to infest some of it into this projects. Last but not least I'm still hungry to learn and to update my Java & IT knowlege. 

### My Role Playing Background
I started with Dungeons & Dragons in 1982. I played D&D and AD&D until I found Rolemaster from ICE in the late eighties. Since then, I play this system with many house rules. Allways also a game master, I'm concentrating on that part since the nineties. My group plays around once in a month a session around 7-8 hours and my Campaigns are going around 10 years in avarage. Of cource I tried also a lot of other systems, but Rolemaster is my favorite.

### My IT Background
I started already in the school before I studied information techniques in a University. In my company I started as a C developer, specialized as a framework and library developer.
Switching first to Smalltalk and then to Java, I was responsible for a 4-8 developer team, moving to agile principles already in 2002. From 2010 to 2021 I was mainly working as a Business Analyst and Software Project Manager. 

### My Current Project(s)
I create the 'Company' RPG-Phoenix on Github, so that others can work with me on my software projects around pen and paper rolepaying services.
Curently I work for my Rolemaster (ICE) compaign on MapTool-Macros to switch from [Roll20](https://app.roll20.net) to [MapTool](https://www.rptools.net/toolbox/maptool/). When this is finished I will go on with the RPG-Phoenix projects as described on there page (not public yet, I want to do one step after the other).

### What Else
I'm German, living in Germany, so english is a foreign language for me. Beeing a legastics makes correct writing not easier :-)
