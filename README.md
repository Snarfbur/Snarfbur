# Introduction

### Why I'm Here
I love fantasy role playing since the eighties and developing software even earlier. I have seen a lot of things coming and going, especially around addons for pen & paper role playing. You can still find a lot of good solutions on the internet, but they are hard to find between all this dead projects. One of the exceptions is the open-source project [MapTool](https://www.rptools.net/toolbox/maptool/) from [RpTools](https://www.rptools.net/).

Second I'm interested in AI and would like to extend [Rails-18xx](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rails/) ([Rails on GitHub](https://github.com/Rails-18xx/)) with some AI features computer gamer.

Both could be done just inside these projects, but I prefer to start alone until I have something to show. Then they can decide to integrate it or I will try to hold it UpToDate by myself.


### Why Now
I just retired and beside travelling around and playing my campaign with my group, this is the first time after 30 years, that I feal that I have enough time to infest some of it into these projects. Last but not least I'm still hungry to learn and to update my Java & IT knowledge. 

### My Role-Playing Background
I started with Dungeons & Dragons in 1982. I played D&D and AD&D until I found ([Rolemaster](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolemaster)) from ICE in the late eighties. Since then, I play this system with many house rules. Always also a game master, I'm concentrating on that part since the nineties. My group plays around once in a month a session around 7-8 hours and my Campaigns are going around 10 years in average. Of course I tried also a lot of other systems, but Rolemaster is my favorite.

### My IT Background
I started already in the school before I studied information techniques in a university. In my company I started as a C developer, specialized as a framework and library developer.
Switching first to Smalltalk and then to Java, I was responsible for a 4-8 developer team, moving to agile principles already in 2002. From 2010 to 2021 I was mainly working as a Business Analyst and Software Project Manager. 

### My Current Project(s)
My first project will be a solution to run MapTool in a Docker environment with access over HTML5 for administration purposes.

### What Else
I'm German, living in Germany, so English is a foreign language for me. Being a dyslexic makes correct writing not easier :-)
